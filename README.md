# Physical Modeling

A University Course during my 3rd term on the Physics studies at University of Wroc≈Çaw.
My overall performance was graded 5 (max. from 2-5 scale).

### The course touched following topics:
* Monte Carlo Integration
* Diffusion-limited Aggregation
* Percolations
* Fractals
* Logistic equations
* Particle in presence of a dot of potential
* Ising Model

### The technologies used for this list were
* C/C++
* GSL Scientific library (mostly Random Number Generation)
* Gnuplot ploting

### My thoughts
This course gave me some insight that pure technical skills can be used to analyze some real problems. Quality of the code is low, but it was an early time of my programming and I was taught with the main priority of analyzing the problem and not producing maintainable code.
